# fakenews-classifications

# Introduction:
  Fake news is a growing problem in today's digital world, spreading misinformation rapidly through social media and other online platforms. It undermines public trust and can have serious impacts on society. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to automatically identify and classify fake news articles, helping to combat the spread of misinformation.

  # Dataset:
    dataset is available on Kaggle, the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification.
